Supporting scripts (Matlab and Python)
========================================

    There are a number of supporting tools to examine the results. These are inside fluxos_python, but it includes also some Matlab scripts.

    Python:  
        
        The most important one is main.py (python script, which relies on a series of supporting python files) that allows to 
        
        (1) cut and slice the data (i.e., get cross section data such as flow); 
        (2) overlay inundation maps in Google Earth (creates klm file);
        (3) converts output data to VTK format.

    Matlab: 
	
	GeoMapping.m: plots the results or DRM in a georeferenced map
