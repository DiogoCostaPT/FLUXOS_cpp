Forcing input file
==================================

    Metereological forcing to the model is provided through timeseries of rainfall and/or snowmelt. The units are mm/day, and the forcing will be applied uniformely across the entire model domain. The first row is for the header and is skipped.
    
    Example:
    
        t (seconds), rain/snowmelt (mm/day)
	
	0,0.151
	
	900,0.144
	
	1800,0.158
	
	2700,0.181
	
	3600,0.181
	
	4500,0.205
	
	5400,0.197
