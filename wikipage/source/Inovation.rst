    FLUXOS-OVERLAND addresses a major modelling gap in Canada related to the characterisationÂ of hydraulic properties at basin scales, which can be important to study complex phenomena such as variable contributing areas in areas found in the Canadian Prairies. Hydrological models tend to rely on simplified routing shemes to reduce computational cost, which do not allow a proper physically-based characterization of spatiotemporal patterns. 

    FLUXOS-OVERLAND solves the dynamic wave for surface water hydrodynamics, also known as the 2-D shallow-water partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from the depth integration of the Navier-Stokes PDEs (i.e., Saint Venant Equations) - that accounts for inertial (local and convective), pressure, gravity, and friction forces (momentum balance). Accounting for inertial forces is an essential, innovative aspect of this model. This is because, unlike with the commonly used kinematic or diffusion waves it captures back-flooding that is an important hydraulic phenomenon in low-relief terrains such as found in the Canadian Prairies. This unique ability has been explored to e.g., to examine hydrological and hydro-chemical connectivity, variable contributing areas, and predominant transport pathways.
