Overview
==================================

    FLUXOS-OVERLAND is an hydrodynamic-solute transport modelling tool suitable for basin-scale, event-based (e.g., snowmelt flooding) simulations in Canada, including the Prairies. Some of the applications to date include analysis of variable contributing areas and predominant transport pathways of the Steppler sub-basin of the South Tobacco Creek watershed. Itâ€™s predecesor, FLUXOS, was originally developed as an integrated SW-GW model.
